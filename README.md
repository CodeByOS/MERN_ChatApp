## 1. Set Up My Project Directory
- I started by creating a new project directory on my machine. This directory serves as the root for all my project files and folders. I made sure to organize it properly by creating separate folders for the backend code, models, and configurations. Keeping everything structured from the beginning has made development much smoother and will help a lot as the project grows.

## 2. Initialize the Backend with Node.js and Express.js
- Next, I set up the backend using Node.js along with the Express.js framework. I chose Express because itâ€™s lightweight and flexible, making it easy to handle HTTP requests, set up routes, and manage middleware. After initializing the Node.js project in my directory, I installed Express, which laid the foundation for building out the API endpoints and handling the server-side logic for my application.

## 3. Install Essential Dependencies
- After getting Express up and running, I installed the key dependencies needed for the project. I added Mongoose to handle interactions with my MongoDB database, and I included Socket.IO to enable real-time features like live chat. Mongoose helps me define clear schemas and models for my data, while Socket.IO allows me to establish real-time, two-way communication between the server and connected clients.

## 4. Configure the Database and Create Models
- Finally, I configured the connection to my MongoDB database using Mongoose. I made sure the connection is stable and secure. After that, I created models to store chat messages and user data. Using Mongoose models helps me structure and validate my data easily. For example, the chat message model includes fields for the sender, the message content, and the timestamp, while the user model keeps track of details like the username, email, and authentication information.
